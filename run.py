    print("""The shipwreck was sudden and violent. You woke up on the shore of a deserted island, surrounded by the wreckage. 
As you stood, aching and disoriented, you heard angry shouts. A group of indigenous people emerged from the jungle,
running towards you with alarming speed. You had to decide quickly: [run] into the forest to hide or [dive] back 
to the ship's remains on the beach to find a weapon. Time was running out, and your fate depended on your next move.""")
